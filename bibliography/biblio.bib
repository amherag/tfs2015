In this ground-breaking book, John Koza shows how this remarkable paradigm works and provides substantial empirical evidence that solutions to a great variety of problems from many different fields can be found by genetically breeding populations of computer programs. Genetic Programming contains a great many worked examples and includes a sample computer code that will allow readers to run their own programs.In getting computers to solve problems without being explicitly programmed, Koza stresses two points: that seemingly different problems from a variety of fields can be reformulated as problems of program induction, and that the recently developed genetic programming paradigm provides a way to search the space of possible computer programs for a highly fit individual computer program to solve the problems of program induction. Good programs are found by evolving them in a computer against a fitness measure instead of by sitting down and writing them.John R.

  abstract = {Stock markets are very important in modern societies and their behavior has serious implications for a wide spectrum of the world's population. Investors, governing bodies, and society as a whole could benefit from better understanding of the behavior of stock markets. The traditional approach to analyzing such systems is the use of analytical models. However, the complexity of financial markets represents a big challenge to the analytical approach. Most analytical models make simplifying assumptions, such as perfect rationality and homogeneous investors, which threaten the validity of their results. This motivates alternative methods.In this paper, we report an artificial financial market and its use in studying the behavior of stock markets. This is an endogenous market, with which we model technical, fundamental, and noise traders. Nevertheless, our primary focus is on the technical traders, which are sophisticated genetic programming based agents that co- evolve (by learning based on their fitness function) by predicting investment opportunities in the market using technical analysis as the main tool. With this endogenous artificial market, we identify the conditions under which the statistical properties of price series in the artificial market resemble some of the properties of real financial markets. By performing a careful exploration of the most important aspects of our simulation model, we determine the way in which the factors of such a model affect the endogenously generated price. Additionally, we model the pressure to beat the market by a behavioral constraint imposed on the agents reflecting the Red Queen principle in evolution. We have demonstrated how evolutionary computation could play a key role in studying stock markets, mainly as a suitable model for economic learning on an agent- based simulation.},

@article{Lu2009,
  abstract = {As financial time series are inherently noisy and non-stationary, it is regarded as one of the most challenging applications of time series forecasting. Due to the advantages of generalization capability in obtaining a unique solution, support vector regression (SVR) has also been successfully applied in financial time series forecasting. In the modeling of financial time series using SVR, one of the key problems is the inherent high noise. Thus, detecting and removing the noise are important but difficult tasks when building an SVR forecasting model. To alleviate the influence of noise, a two-stage modeling approach using independent component analysis (ICA) and support vector regression is proposed in financial time series forecasting. ICA is a novel statistical signal processing technique that was originally proposed to find the latent source signals from observed mixture signals without having any prior knowledge of the mixing mechanism. The proposed approach first uses ICA to the forecasting variables for generating the independent components (ICs). After identifying and removing the ICs containing the noise, the rest of the ICs are then used to reconstruct the forecasting variables which contain less noise and served as the input variables of the SVR forecasting model. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the Nikkei 225 opening index and TAIEX closing index are used as illustrative examples. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the SVR model with non-filtered forecasting variables and a random walk model.},

  abstract = {Modeling and estimating the time series (the value in time) of assets traded in real financial markets is an intriguing challenge that has attracted researchers from many fields including Economics, Statistics, and more recently Computer Science thanks to the common availability of computational power that made possible the investigation of computational or simulative methods for modeling financial time series. In this paper, we discuss a computational simulation technique based on agent based modeling and learning to closely approximate the SP500 and DJIA indexes over many periods and under several experimental set ups. According to our modeling approach, the value in time of a financial asset emerges as an aggregate result of several independent investment decisions (to buy, to sell, or to hold) during a short period of time. We can therefore reproduce the process of value formation by computationally simulating the community of agents-investors. We will compare our system's performances with respect to other approaches on the same time series to provide empirical data about the effectiveness of different computational techniques. The main finding emerging from our work is that a simple architecture for a simulator combining agent based modeling and learning produces close approximations for the SP500 and DJIA time series. The approximation results are comparable to those observed when evaluating prediction rules learned by neural networks or particle swarm optimization. An additional characteristic of our modeling approach is that it can provide insights about the contribution of each agent to the process of value formation for a financial asset.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new architecture to study artificial stock markets. This architecture rests on a mechanism called 'school' which is a procedure to map the phenotype to the genotype or, in plain English, to uncover the secret of success. We propose an agent-based model of 'school', and consider school as an evolving population driven by single-population GP (SGP). The architecture also takes into consideration traders' search behavior. By simulated annealing, traders' search density can be connected to psychological factors, such as peer pressure or economic factors such as the standard of living. This market architecture was then implemented in a standard artificial stock market. Our econometric study of the resultant artificial time series evidences that the return series is independently and identically distributed (iid), and hence supports the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). What is interesting though is that this iid series was generated by traders, who do not believe in the EMH at all. In fact, our study indicates that many of our traders were able to find useful signals quite often from business school, even though these signals were short-lived. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The three approaches presented take inspiration from reinforcement learning, myopic trading using regression-based price prediction, and market making. These ap- proaches are fully implemented and tested with results reported here, including individual evaluations using a fixed opponent strategy and a comparative analysis of the strategies in a joint simulation. The market-making strategy described in this paper was the winner in the fall 2003 PLAT live competition and the runner- up in the spring 2004 live competition, exhibiting consistent profitability. The strategy’s performance in the live competitions is presented and analyzed.},

Therefore, researches on finding internal rules and establishing an efficient stock forecast model to help investors minimize risks and maximize returns are very practical and amazing. In this paper, a hybrid model FTSGA based on fuzzy time series and genetic algorithm is proposed. FTSGA improves the performance by applying the operations of genetic algorithm such as selection, crossover and mutation to iteratively search a good discourse partition. TAIEX is selected as the experimental data set. And experimental results show that comparing with other models based on fuzzy time series FTSGA can greatly reduce the root mean square error and improve accuracy.},

  abstract = {Financial market prediction and trading presents a challenging task that attracts great interest from researchers and investors because success may result in substantial rewards. This paper describes the application of a hierarchical coevolutionary fuzzy system called HiCEFS for predicting financial time series. A novel financial trading system using HiCEFS as a predictive model and employing a prudent trading strategy based on the price percentage oscillator (PPO) is proposed. In order to construct an accurate predictive model, a form of generic membership function named irregular shaped membership function (ISMF) is employed and a hierarchical coevolutionary genetic algorithm (HCGA) is adopted to automatically derive the ISMFs for each input feature in HiCEFS. With the accurate prediction from HiCEFS and the prudent trading strategy, the proposed system outperforms the simple buy-and-hold strategy, the trading system without prediction and the trading system with other predictive models (EFuNN, DENFIS and RSPOP) on real-world financial data.},

@article{Homaifar1995,
  abstract = {This paper examines the applicability of genetic algorithms (GA’s) in the simultaneous design of membership functions and rule sets for fuzzy logic controllers. Previous work using genetic algorithms has focused on the development of rule sets or high performance membership functions; however, the interdependence between these two components suggests a simultaneous design procedure would be a more appropriate methodology. When GA’s have been used to develop both, it has been done serially, e.g., design the membership functions and then use them in the design of the rule set. This, however, means that the membership functions were optimized for the initial rule set and not the rule set designed subsequently. GA’s are fully capable of creating complete fuzzy controllers given the equations of motion of the system, eliminating the need for human input in the design loop. This new method has been applied to two problems, a cart controller and a truck controller. Beyond the development of these controllers, we also examine the design of a robust controller for the cart problem and its ability to overcome faulty rules},

Most of the previous approaches for classification problem are based on classification rules generated by decision trees. In this paper, we propose a new learning approach based on genetic programming to generate discriminant functions for classifying data. An adaptable incremental learning strategy and a distance-based fitness function are developed to improve the efficiency of genetic programming-based learning process. We first transform attributes of objects into fuzzy attributes and then a set of discriminant functions is generated based on the proposed learning procedure. The set of derived functions with fuzzy attributes gives high accuracy of classification and presents a linear form. Hence, the functions can be transformed into inference rules easily and we can use the rules to provide the building of rule base in an expert system. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Identification of the right combination of indicators for optimal portfolio performance has always been a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning approach to generate trading signals (buy / sell) using a combination of technical indicators. Proposed system uses a genetic algorithm along with principle component analysis to identify a subset of technical indicators which detect rise and fall of the market with greater accuracy and generates realistic trading signals. The performance of this new algorithm was tested using trading data obtained from National Stock Exchange (NSE), India. Simulation shows the enhanced profitability for the proposed trading strategy},
